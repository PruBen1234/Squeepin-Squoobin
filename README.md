This was my attempt at a turn based game written in python. I'm new to coding and new to python especially so here's a small simple game.

Things that need to be fixed:
 - here are balance issues with certain characters either being too strong or not strong enough. 
 - There is a lack of options
 - An unworked glitch where if the user presses enter on the action menu, the turn continues as normal.


This was initially made as a simple experience in managing menus using while loops and not needing a force exit. 
Was using an old version of Spyder without the code folding which is ABSOLUTELY necessary for organizing a 1000 line program. 

This program is very poorly commented. If there are any questions regarding what a line of code is used for, please contact me.
